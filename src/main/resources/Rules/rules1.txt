THERE ARE THREE GAME MODES.


ORIGINAL:

the aim of this mode is making you
grow the snake as much as you can and as fast
as you can, not letting the snake hit itself.


MULTIPLAYER:

in this general mode two players
are going to play against each other (ARROW
KEYS and WASD), try as hard as you can to make
the other snake touch your body in order to
kill them.


CHALLENGE:

the challenge mode will have
different levels and you'll need to avoid
hitting the walls and try to grow the snake
until the door opens in order to escape.
