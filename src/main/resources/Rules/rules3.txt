eating a ORANGE will not affect your speed but
increase your size by 1.


eating an PEACH will halven your speed and
decrease your size by 3.


there is also a MISTERY fruit that can affect
your speed and your size randomly every time
it spawns.


to navigate through the menus you must use the
ARROW KEYS and ENTER. or use ANY KEY when it
says so.


in every game mode you can press 'P' to pause
the game at any time and you can press 'Q' to
quit to the main menu.


GOOD LUCK ;)
